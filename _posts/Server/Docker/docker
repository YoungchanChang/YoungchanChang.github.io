GCP 도커

권한 있나 먼저 확인 : gcloud config list

If you do

gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/X/Y

docker push로 해도 안 됨

you will need to have permission to write to the GCP named 'X'. Typically you will need to be added to that project as a project EDITOR.

In this case GCR does not complain about the project shown by 'gcloud info'.
